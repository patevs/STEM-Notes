      <description>Node Package Manager (NPM) is the world&amp;rsquo;s largest software registry, with approximately 3 billion downloads per week. npm opens up an entire world of JavaScript talent to you and to your team. The registry contains over 600,000 packages (building blocks of code).
Open-source developers from every continent share and borrow packages through npm, accessing algorithms designed across the planet or across the street. Packages follow specific structures to enable you to track and manage versions and multiple dependencies.</description>
