You can follow the Hugo Quick Start Guide for that.\nThe next step is to install a theme. Instructions for doing so can be found in the Hugo themes documentation.\nA list of all available themes can be browsed here.\nThe theme I have chosen to use for this website is cloned from: achary/engimo\nInstalling a Theme There are two different ways you can install Engimo as a theme:\n Clone repo:  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/achary/engimo themes/engimo  As a submodule  git submodule add https://github.com/achary/engimo themes/engimo This will add Engimo\u0026rsquo;s repository as a submodule to your site\u0026rsquo;s repository. Now, you will have to pull/update the theme:\ngit submodule init git submodule update The second method is recommended.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all, Engimo is ready to be used.\n","href":"/docs/hugo/","title":"Hugo Framework"},{"content":"  NodeJS is an asyncronous event driven JavaScript runtime built on Chrome\u0026rsquo;s V8 JavaScript engine and comes with its own preinstalled package manager called npm.\nNode Package Manager (NPM) is the world\u0026rsquo;s largest software registry, with approximately 3 billion downloads per week. npm opens up an entire world of JavaScript talent to you and to your team. The registry contains over 600,000 packages (building blocks of code).\nOpen-source developers from every continent share and borrow packages through npm, accessing algorithms designed across the planet or across the street. Packages follow specific structures to enable you to track and manage versions and multiple dependencies. Node.js Download\n Getting Started If you\u0026rsquo;re using OSX or Windows, use one of the installers from the Node.js download page linked above. Be sure to install the version labeled LTS. Other versions have not yet been tested with npm.\nInstalling Node\n\nInstalling Local Packages There are two ways to install npm packages: locally or globally. Choose which kind of installation to use based on how you want to use the package.\n If you want to depend on the package from your own module, using something like Node.js\u0026rsquo; require, then you want to install locally. This is npm install\u0026rsquo;s default behavior. If you want to use a package as a command line tool, (such as grunt CLI), then install it globally.  Installing Packages\nPackages and Modules\n\nWorking with package.json The best way to manage locally installed npm packages is to create a package.json file.\nA package.json file:\n Lists the packages that your project depends on.\n Allows you to specify the versions of a package that your project can use using semantic versioning rules.\n Makes your build reproducible, and therefore much easier to share with other developers.\n  Requirements A package.json must have:\n name  all lowercase one word, no spaces dashes and underscores allowed  version  in the form of x.x.x follows semver spec e.g.:   { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;my-awesome-package\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1.0.0\u0026quot; }  \nCreating a package.json There are two basic ways to create a package.json file.\n Run a CLI questionnaire To create a package.json with values that you supply, run:\n\u0026gt; npm init  This will initiate a command line questionnaire that will conclude with the creation of a package.json in the directory in which you initiated the command.\n To get a default package.json, run npm init with the \u0026ndash;yes or -y flag:\n\u0026gt; npm init --yes  This method will generate a default package.json using information extracted from the current directory.   \nNodeJS Local Server If Node.js is already downloaded and installed in your system, you can easily set up a simple HTTP web server on your system using Node.js. Install the http-server package from npm To do this, follow these steps outlined below:\n Open a command prompt / command line window in the administrator mode\n Enter the following command:\nnpm install -g http-server  Switch to the directory containing the web files\n Start the web server with this following command:\nhttp-server -o   That\u0026rsquo;s all you need to do, The -o automatically opens the web server in your browser. You can also enter just http-server and manually browse to http://localhost:8080 from your web browser.
